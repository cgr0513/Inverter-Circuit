The circuit has two different parts
  a. Booster

  b. Inverter

The booster has switching PWM duty cycle with 0.725 to create a voltage drop of 12V
Inverter is present to create a negative voltage when the user needs the negative voltage output.

The simulation output of output voltage is shown below

Time takes for the circuit to stabalize is between 2 ms to 3 ms which is short enough to control the motor direction
